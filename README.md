## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight language for formatting text using plain characters.  
It’s used to create clean and styled documentation, especially in README files on GitHub.

dont know if i needed to explain what it is or just use it, its kind of easy tho.

not gonna lie didnt know if i needed to do it on english or spanish so i said english since the class is in english.
i love cats btw also sorry if i trauma dump y'all.
